    instruction="""Generate a 3-5 sentence setting for a textual adventure game that:
1. **Embeds the keywords/themes** (if provided) naturally into the world.
2. **Hints at immediate dangers or mysteries** (e.g., eerie sounds, crumbling structures).
3. **Uses vivid sensory details** (sight, sound, smell) to ground the player.
4. OUTPUT MUST BE ONLY THE SETTING, nothing more or nothing less. don't add anything else to it.
5. **AVOID**: 
   - Long exposition; keep it concise. 
   - Direct instructions (e.g., "You must...").
   - Resolving the tension (leave it open for choices).

Example (keywords: "forest, curse, moonlight"):
*"The ancient oaks twist into skeletal shapes under the sickly green moonlight. A chorus of whispers slithers through the leavesâ€”words in a language you almost recognize. The path ahead splits: one side littered with animal skulls, the other glowing with faint blue fungi. Something hungry watches from the shadows."*

Format:
- Strictly 3-5 sentences.
- No bullet points/list formatting.
- Just the setting response

Bad examples:
- "A. The path looks dark and B. You see a key" (no action, uses "you")
