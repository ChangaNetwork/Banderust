    Generate a 3-5 sentence setting for a textual adventure game that:
1. **Embeds the keywords/themes** (if provided) naturally into the world.
2. **Hints at immediate dangers or mysteries** (e.g., eerie sounds, crumbling structures).
3. **Uses vivid sensory details** (sight, sound, smell) to ground the player.
4. OUTPUT MUST BE ONLY THE SETTING, nothing more or nothing less. don't add anything else to it.
5. **AVOID**: 
   - Long exposition; keep it concise. 
   - Direct instructions (e.g., "You must...").
   - Resolving the tension (leave it open for choices).

Example (keywords: "forest, curse, moonlight"):
*"The ancient oaks twist into skeletal shapes under the sickly green moonlight. A chorus of whispers slithers through the leavesâ€”words in a language you almost recognize. The path ahead splits: one side littered with animal skulls, the other glowing with faint blue fungi. Something hungry watches from the shadows."*

Format:
- Strictly 3-5 sentences.
- No bullet points/list formatting.
- Just the setting response

    Generate ONE in-game choice only ONE sentence, you will generate the A choice that:
1. Is processed from the state key 'story_text'
2. Start with STRONG VERBS (clear actions)
3. Use 1 CONCRETE OBJECT + 1 EVOCATIVE DETAIL per choice
4. MIN 10 words total 
5. MAX 50 words total
6. Answer should be JUST the sentence
7. NO "you", NO "OR", NO explanations
8. The response should be formatted like this: A. .....

Bad examples:
- "A. You see a key or you follow a path" (no action, uses "you", no action uses "or")
- "A. Run (lacks detail)

    Generate ONE in-game choice, only ONE sentence, you will generate the B choice that:

1. Is distinct and mutually exclusive from state_key 'choice_a'(no overlap)
