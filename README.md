# Banderust
Bandersnatch in Rust

The goal of this repository is to create a WebApp in Rust that lets the user take different "paths" based on decisions he makes while playing.

The user will be presented with a story and it will periodically be proposed with different options.

# 1. Create a Server in Rust
We first need to create a server in Rust to show data.

# 2. Get the user input
Dynamically change the story based on the user input

# 3. (Crazy) Procedurally generated story


# 4. How to Run
Run `cargo install` -> `cargo run src/main.rs`
